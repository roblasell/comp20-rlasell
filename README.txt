===============================================================

This is a README for the Github repo "comp20-rlasell".
This repo holds Rob Lasell's projects and other assignments from Ming 
Chow's Web Programming class at Tufts University (Spring 2014).

My favorite project was probably the MBTA tracker project; I liked
using the Google maps API. Similarly, I think that I am also the most
proud of that project.

I think this class set me on the path to becoming a good web programmer,
although there is still a long way to go. In particular, it taught me
to find the answers to my questions on my own (read: my Google-fu grows
strong). Plus, I have a website now!
