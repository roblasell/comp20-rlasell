		<h1>2048 Gamecenter Security Assessment</h1>
		<div id="info">Rob Lasell, 22 February 2014</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p id="intro">
			This is an assessment of security vulnerabilities present in Sean Deneen's 2048 Gamecenter web app, created with node, express, and heroku. A working 2048 Gamecenter is supposed to receive scores, usernames, grids, and timestamps from a 2048 game client before displaying them in order of decreasing score, as well as be able to report back grids and scores for a particular username. There is a high potential for many different kinds of security flaws in a web app like this, and I was hired to detect and report on any such flaws.

		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p id="methods">
			I began with "black box" testing, using only the heroku web app provided to me by Mr. Deneen. I probed for weaknesses by sending data using a modified 2048 game client very similar to the ones used by many of Ming Chow's Comp 20 students to test their Gamecenters. After the black box testing, I turned to Mr. Deneen's source code in order to find remaining vulnerabilities.
